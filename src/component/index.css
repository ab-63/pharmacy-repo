 Design Decisions for Pharmacy Management System
1. Layout & Structure
Use a sidebar + top bar layout:

Sidebar (left): Navigation (Dashboard, Inventory, Sales, Prescriptions, Reports, Settings)

Top bar (header): User profile, notifications, logout

Main content area: Displays each page’s data (tables, forms, charts)

✅ This makes it look like a real admin panel and gives good UX.

2. Color Palette
Primary color: Green (healthcare theme) – e.g. #10B981 (Tailwind’s emerald-500)

Secondary color: Blue for highlights – e.g. #3B82F6 (Tailwind’s blue-500)

Background: Light gray #F9FAFB (Tailwind’s gray-50)

Text: Dark gray #111827 for readability

✅ Green is linked with healthcare, freshness, and trust.

3. Typography
Font: Use a clean sans-serif like Inter or Roboto

Sizes:

Page titles: text-2xl font-bold

Section titles: text-lg font-semibold

Body text: text-sm or text-base

✅ Keep it readable, professional, and consistent.

4. Components
Buttons: Rounded with clear color meaning

Primary: Green (Save, Add, Checkout)

Secondary: Gray/blue (Cancel, Back)

Tables:

Striped rows (odd:bg-gray-50)

Action buttons (Edit, Delete) with icons

Forms:

Two-column layout for larger forms

Required fields marked with *

Cards (Dashboard):

Small stat cards with icons (e.g., 💊 Medicines, 📦 Low Stock, 🕒 Expiring Soon, 💵 Sales Today)

5. Navigation Flow
Login → Dashboard → (choose module)

Inventory: Add/edit → automatically updates list

Sales: Search medicine → add to cart → checkout → generate invoice

Prescriptions: Add prescription → select medicines → save → link to stock

Reports: Export to PDF/CSV optional (stretch goal)

6. UI Tools (for intern to use)
Frontend:

Tailwind CSS (simple, fast, professional)

Optionally ShadCN UI or Material UI for ready-made components

Charts (Reports):

Use Recharts (React) or Chart.js (if simple)

7. Example Page Layouts
Dashboard:
Grid with 4 cards (Total Medicines, Today’s Sales, Low Stock, Expired) + simple sales chart

Inventory:
Table of medicines + “Add Medicine” button → modal/form

Sales:
Search bar + list → Add to Cart → Cart summary → Checkout button

Prescriptions:
Form with patient info + medicine selection dropdown

Reports:
Date filter + table/chart of sales
